### SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR THE HOTEL REVIEWS:
Sentiment Analysis  is a sub-field of NLP that is used to identify and extract opinions within a given text across blogs, reviews, social media, forums, news etc. which involves classifying texts or parts of texts into a pre-defined sentiment. In general it is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral. Such algorithms dig deep into the text and find the stuff that points out at the attitude towards the product in general or its specific element.

### HOW IT THEORETICALLY WORKâ€™S?
1.	Find and extract the opinionated data on a specific platform (customer support, reviews, etc.)
2.	Determine its polarity (positive or negative)
3.	Define the subject matter (what is being talked about in general and specifically)
4.	Identify the opinion holder. 

### Build A Sentiment Analysis model.
1.	Upload your training dataset.
2.	Clean your dataset.
3.	Train your sentiment analysis model.
4.	Test your sentiment classifier.
5.	Put your sentiment analysis model to work.

In our project we had follow the typical machine learning pipeline. We will first import the required libraries and the dataset. We will then do exploratory data analysis to see if we can find any trends in the dataset. Next, we will perform text preprocessing that can be used by a machine learning algorithm. Finally, we will use machine learning technique to train and test our sentiment analysis models.
